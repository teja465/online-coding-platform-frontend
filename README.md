If anyone intrested to Improve or Add  any  feature please send me a mail so we can discuss about it
# Online coding platform where users can select a question from available questions and type code and check whether their code passes all testcases or not.

**Features need to be added (putting featues to this list to track my progress)**

 0)  Sync "code user is typing" with localStorage   [ **Done** ]
 1)  Add Contribute question page  ( Question neeed to be validated by admin(superuser) before showing to users on website) 
 2)  Add Contribute testcase page .
 3)  Add submit button and upon clicking it we should validate with private testcases and crate a record in ProblemSubmissions table
 4)  If user opens a question and if he already got "AC" for that question it should show as "SOLVED"(Create an end point which takes quetionID and user_id and  checks whether  he      got "AC" for that question  or no)
 5)  Try to restrict number of submissions as we are running out of free  api requests
 6)  Restrict private and public test cases for any problem to 50+50
 7)  Add authentication 
 8)  Create user profile page
 9)  show numbers  of question solved category wise(Easy,Medium,Hard) in profile page 
 10)  Enable users to create contests and limit no of questions to 5 for ach contest
